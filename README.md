# Clustering-Project
#Implementation of K-Means algorithm using Pyhton.
K-means algorithm capable of partitioning a dataset into clusters based on their similarity. Specify the number of clusters (which is a hyper parameter) that we want the data to be grouped  into. Hyper parameters are adjustable parameters choose to train a model that carries out the  training process itself.
#Steps of K-means clustering:
    -Step 1: Choose the number of clusters k
    -Step 2: Select k random points from the data as centroids 
    -Step 3: Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid 
    -Step 4: Re-compute the centroids of newly formed clusters 
    -Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 
#And once the: 
• Centroids of newly formed clusters do not change 
• Points remain in the same cluster 
• Maximum number of iterations are reached and we can stop the K-means algorithm.
